- This program uses Windows Console funtion to play Beep-sound with different frequencies and durations of beep
- I used beeps to play with some things I wanted to learn. So here's the list of features:
  - Music intro with prepared beep's data and ASCII-images
  - TCP Server/Client exchanging beep's data (both work asynchronous in one process)
  - HTTP-request to Hugging Face API for user's choosen song (result is parsed by regex to extract beep's data)
  - Inserting and getting beepsongs into/from PostgreSQL Database (from the Hugging Face API)
- Builded program with file examples and source code are here for you to try things and learn something, don't forget to change API key in the source code!
